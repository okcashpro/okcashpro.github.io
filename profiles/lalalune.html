trust marketplace. This is basically putting orders into an orderbook, and then seeing how those orders would have done in an ideal sell or hold scenario. You can't blame someone for the bot making a stupidly timed sell if they gave you excellent alpha.\r\n\r\nThe first part is just to collect trades in the orderbook. Then we can analyze the data and come up with a weighting strategy.\r\n\r\nThe second part is calculating trust. I think that we care about a weighting of two things -- 30% how much skin they have in the game and 70% how much they've made in the virtual orderbook.\r\n\r\nThese memecoins are such that you'll pick 10 losers and still 10x your money on the 1 winner, finding the winners and maximizing likelihood of win is critical. One parabolic recommendation can give a user a lot of trust.\r\n\r\nUsers will copytrust each other, so there needs to be value in being the first to shill a ticker. We want to weight this against users just shilling every ticker first to try to game the system with a few 100xes.\r\n\r\nFor the actual execution of trade, we can run this on a loop with a randomized tick. 90% of the time, Marc should not execute a trade, but should wake up and analyze the market. When to trade, what and why are the most complicated parts, but this is more of a quality issue than a possibility issue-- quite easy to make the trade happen at all, but hard to get the right details.\r\n\r\nThe plan is just to get it there, to where its making decent consensus trades, and then we can let the quant guys go nuts on our codebase.\r\n","created_at":"2024-10-28T22:37:16Z","url":"https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/issues/52#issuecomment-2442803866","type":"issue","issue_number":"52"},{"id":2443163754,"body":"Hmmm, hmu on discord (new.moon) and lets fix it.","created_at":"2024-10-29T04:11:54Z","url":"https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/issues/70#issuecomment-2443163754","type":"issue","issue_number":"70"},{"id":2443628458,"body":"@sirkitree please take a look.

Right now we have a shouldRespond handler that determines if the bot should respond, using a cheap model. If so, we respond.
