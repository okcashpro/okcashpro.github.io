Module resolution and file extensions\n2. Incorrect usage of BigNumber constructor\n3. Incorrect usage of youtube-dl-exec\n4. Missing type definitions\n5. Node version compatibility\n\nHere are the suggested fixes:\n\n1. **Module Resolution Issues**\nThe TypeScript compiler is complaining about missing file extensions in imports when using Node16/NodeNext module resolution. You need to add `.js` extensions to relative imports. For example:\n\n```typescript\n// Before\nimport { Something } from '../core/types'\n\n// After\nimport { Something } from '../core/types.js'\n```\n\n2. **BigNumber Construction Issues**\nThere are multiple errors related to BigNumber construction from the bignumber.js package. The correct way to use it is:\n\n```typescript\n// Before\nnew BigNumber(value)\n\n// After \nBigNumber(value) // or\nnew BigNumber.BigNumber(value)\n```\n\n3. **YouTube DL Exec Issues**\nThe youtube-dl-exec package is not being called correctly. You need to use its default export:\n\n```typescript\n// Before\nyoutubedl(url, options)\n\n// After\nyoutubedl.default(url, options)\n```\n\n4. **PDF.js Types Issue**\nMissing type definitions for pdfjs-dist. Add the types to devDependencies:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@types/pdfjs-dist\": \"^2.10.378\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHere are the specific files that need updates:\n\n1. Update tsconfig.json to handle module resolution:\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"node16\",\n    \"allowImportingTsExtensions\": true,\n    \"resolveJsonModule\": true,\n    \"allowJs\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n2. Update CI workflow to use the correct Node version:\n\n```17:20:.github/workflows/ci.yaml\n            - uses: actions/setup-node@v4\n              with:\n                  node-version: \"23\"\n                  cache: \"pnpm\"\n```\n\nChange to:\n```yaml\n- uses: actions/setup-node@v4\n  with:\n    node-version: \"22\"\n    cache: \"pnpm\"\n```\n\n3. Add script to fix extensions:\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nfind src -type f -name \"*.ts\" -exec sed -i 's/from \"\\(\\.\\.?\\/.*\\)\"/from \"\\1.js\"/g' {} +\n```\n\n","created_at":"2024-11-02T19:59:03Z","url":"https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/issues/174#issuecomment-2453111649","type":"issue","issue_number":"174"},{"id":2453470185,"body":"ci was failing so the last few commits here do the following:\r\n\r\nThere are two main types of issues in the build:\r\n1.

Does converting to this standard protocol enhance that at all? I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nBased on the extensive MCP documentation provided, here are some hypothetical benefits of integrating MCP into this codebase:\r\n\r\n1. **Standardized AI-System Communication**\r\n    - The codebase could leverage MCP's standardized protocol for communication between the AI (Claude) and various system resources\r\n    - This would provide a more structured and secure way to handle interactions compared to custom implementations\r\n\r\n2. **Resource Management**\r\n    - MCP's resource system could help manage character files and data in a standardized way\r\n    - Characters could be exposed as MCP resources with proper MIME types and metadata\r\n    - Real-time updates to character data could leverage MCP's resource subscription system\r\n\r\n3. **Tool Integration**\r\n    - MCP tools could provide standardized ways to:\r\n      - Read/write character files\r\n      - Validate character data\r\n      - Perform character-related operations\r\n      - Handle file system operations securely\r\n    - Tools could be exposed with clear schemas and descriptions for the AI to understand\r\n\r\n4. **Security Benefits**\r\n    - MCP's security model would provide better isolation and control over what the AI can access\r\n    - Built-in validation and sanitization of inputs\r\n    - Controlled access to file system and other resources\r\n    - Clear error handling patterns\r\n\r\n5. **Development Benefits**\r\n    - Better debugging capabilities through MCP Inspector\r\n    - Standardized logging and error reporting\r\n    - Clear separation between AI capabilities and system operations\r\n    - Type safety through SDK integrations\r\n    - Built-in progress reporting for long operations\r\n\r\n6. **Extensibility**\r\n    - Easy addition of new capabilities through MCP servers\r\n    - Potential to integrate with other tools and services\r\n    - Standardized way to add new features that interact with the AI\r\n\r\n7. **Testing & Maintenance**\r\n    - Better testing capabilities through MCP Inspector\r\n    - Clear protocol specifications make maintenance easier\r\n    - Standard patterns for error handling and logging\r\n    - Built-in tools for debugging and monitoring\r\n\r\nThis would represent a shift from custom implementations to a standardized protocol, potentially making the codebase more maintainable and extensible while improving security and reliability.\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-07T17:24:40Z","url":"https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/issues/844#issuecomment-2525252311","type":"issue","issue_number":"844"}],"total_comments":60}},"summary":"sirkitree is actively contributing to the project by focusing on features like video generation plugins, services, and automated security scanning.
